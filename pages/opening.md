summary: Little presentation post

Here we are. I finally decided to install a blog engine.

I chose to use [Pelican] [1] for various reasons like its [KISS] [2]
philosophy, the fact it's written in Python and its [Markdown] [3] syntax
support. I will probably write a post to present this engine as soon as
I trialled it a bit.

The main interest of this tool, as far as i'm concerned, will be to record a
number of tips of all kind so that I can later reference.

It turns out that by chance coincidences, I must, as part of my studies,
create a portfolio so this blog may meet both objectives.

I'll make sure that my posts are accurate and didactic so they can also
be usefull for others.

I think cover different IT related areas and particularly Python programming
and [GNU/Linux] [4] system administration.

So, the only thing left to do is to write !
