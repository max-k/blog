### History of a french free software enthousiast

Experienced system administrator on mixed environments,
i am now a software developper, specialized in free software.

I discovered them about 10 years ago, during my studies.

More than a vocation, this is actually for me an inexhaustible passion,
a way of life.

I try to contribute to free software community everytime it is possible,
in all the manner i can. Packaging, documentation, translation, bug tracking,
bug fixing or code contributions...
